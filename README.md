# üñãÔ∏è QuillInsight

**QuillInsight** is an AI-powered note-taking web application designed to help users capture, organize, and extract insights from their notes.  
Unlike traditional note apps, QuillInsight doesn‚Äôt just store information‚Äîit **summarizes, categorizes, and highlights key ideas automatically**.  

Built with students, researchers, and professionals in mind, QuillInsight makes knowledge management faster, smarter, and more accessible.

## üîñ Project Overview

### What We‚Äôre Building
A web-based note-taking platform that combines **simplicity of writing** with the **power of AI-driven insights**.  
Users can:
- Write and save notes in a clean editor.  
- Organize notes with folders and tags.  
- Use AI to **summarize text, generate highlights, and auto-tag notes**.  

### Who It‚Äôs For
- **Students & Researchers** ‚Üí to distill large readings into key points.  
- **Professionals** ‚Üí to document meetings and receive action summaries.  
- **Lifelong Learners** ‚Üí to capture quick thoughts and generate structured ideas.  

### Why It Matters
In today‚Äôs world of information overload, simply taking notes is not enough.  
QuillInsight empowers users by **turning raw notes into structured knowledge**‚Äîmaking recall, review, and learning more effective.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) + [React](https://react.dev/) + [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)  
- **Backend & Database:** [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) (Postgres, Auth, Storage)  
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS  
- **AI Layer:** OpenAI API (for summarization, tagging, insights)  
- **Deployment:** Vercel (frontend), Supabase cloud services (backend)  
- **Version Control & Collaboration:** Git + GitHub

## üß† AI Integration Strategy

We will integrate AI not only in the **app features** but also in the **development workflow** to accelerate building and maintain code quality.  

### 1. Code Generation
- Use AI-native IDE & CLI agents to scaffold React components, Next.js API routes, and Supabase queries.  
- Generate reusable UI components with Tailwind, reducing time spent on boilerplate code.  
- Automate CRUD logic for notes and folders.  

### 2. Testing
- Use AI prompts to generate **unit tests** (React Testing Library, Jest) for components like the editor, search, and note display.  
- Scaffold **integration tests** for Supabase queries (auth, note creation, and retrieval).  
- Use AI to quickly suggest edge cases and improve test coverage.  

### 3. Documentation
- AI-assisted **docstrings** for functions and React components.  
- Inline comments generated with AI explanations to maintain clarity.  
- Keep `README.md` and API docs consistent by prompting AI to update based on recent commits or diffs.  

### 4. Context-Aware Techniques
- Feed **file trees** and **API specifications** into AI prompts for more accurate, context-aware code suggestions.  
- Provide **git diffs** to AI agents for generating commit messages, PR descriptions, and release notes.  
- Use Supabase schema exports to inform AI when generating queries or migration scripts.
